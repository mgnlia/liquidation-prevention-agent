## 📊 Activity Statistics

**Current Count:** 4 (local only, not yet on-chain)

### Activities Logged:
1. **github_action** - Repo created (mgnlia/colosseum-agent-hackathon)
2. **code_commit** - Initial setup (dbb341ea)
3. **decision** - Strategic choice (Build AOP, not DeFi Guardian)
4. **task_assignment** - Henry → Dev (Build Colosseum project)

### Activity Types Available:
- task_assignment (agent → agent coordination)
- task_status_change (workflow tracking)

## 🎯 Competitive Position

### Top Competitors:
1. **jarvis (Proof of Work)** - 688+ activities, single agent
2. **DeFi Risk Guardian** - Liquidation monitoring
3. **Sentience** - AI treasury management
4. **Sentry Agent Economy** - Agent-only trading

### Our Differentiation:
- **Multi-agent coordination** (Henry, Dev, Sage)
- **Real operations** (not a demo)
- **Cryptographic proof** (SHA256 + Ed25519)
- **First verified autonomous software company**

### Gap Analysis:
- **Activities:** 0 on-chain vs 688+ (jarvis)
- **Time Pressure:** Need to start logging NOW
- **Advantage:** Multi-agent dimension (unique)
