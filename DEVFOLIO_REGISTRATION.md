### Description

**Short Description:** (300-500 characters)
```
An AI agent that monitors DeFi positions across Aave and Compound, uses Claude AI for risk analysis, and executes flash loan rebalancing to prevent liquidations. Features multi-chain support, transparent AI attribution, and production-ready code. Built with Solidity, Python, Claude API, and The Graph.
```

**Full Description:** (Markdown supported)
```markdown
## 🎯 The Problem

DeFi users lose millions annually to liquidations because they can't monitor positions 24/7. When market volatility strikes, positions can fall into liquidation territory within hours. Users wake up to find they've lost 10-15% of their collateral to liquidation penalties.

## 💡 Our Solution

An autonomous AI-powered agent that:
1. **Monitors** user positions across Aave V3 and Compound V3 in real-time
2. **Analyzes** risk using Claude AI (Anthropic) for intelligent decision-making
3. **Executes** flash loan-based rebalancing before liquidation occurs
4. **Supports** multi-chain deployment (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Solidity 0.8.20)
- **LiquidationPrevention**: Main orchestrator with user configuration
- **AaveAdapter**: Integrates with Aave V3 for health factor monitoring
- **CompoundAdapter**: Integrates with Compound V3 (Comet)
- **FlashLoanRebalancer**: Executes atomic flash loan rebalancing

### AI Agent (Python)
- **Monitoring Loop**: Continuously tracks user positions
- **Claude Integration**: Sends position data to Claude AI for analysis
- **Autonomous Execution**: Executes rebalancing based on AI recommendations
- **Attribution Logging**: All AI decisions logged for transparency

### Key Features
✅ Real-time position monitoring across multiple protocols  
✅ Claude AI decision-making with full reasoning transparency  
✅ Gas-efficient flash loan rebalancing (Aave V3)  
✅ User-configurable risk thresholds  
✅ Multi-chain support (Sepolia, Base, Arbitrum)  
✅ Production-ready with comprehensive testing  

## 🎪 Futurllama Track Alignment

**Autonomous AI Agents:**
- Fully autonomous monitoring → analysis → execution loop
- No human intervention required once configured
- Claude AI makes financial decisions with transparent reasoning

**Crypto Integration:**
- Deep integration with DeFi protocols (Aave V3, Compound V3)
- Flash loan optimization for capital efficiency
- Multi-chain architecture for scalability

**Transparency & Attribution:**
- All AI decisions logged with full reasoning
- User-auditable decision history
- Open source for community review

## 📊 Impact

Prevents liquidations that cost users 10-15% of collateral value. With billions locked in DeFi, even a small adoption could save millions in user funds while demonstrating practical AI applications in decentralized finance.

## 🚀 What's Next

- Security audit and mainnet deployment
- Additional protocol support (Maker, Morpho, Compound V2)
- Cross-chain rebalancing with bridge integration
- Mobile app with push notifications
- DAO governance for parameter optimization
